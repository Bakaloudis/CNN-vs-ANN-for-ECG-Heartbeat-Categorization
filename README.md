# CNN-vs-ANN-for-ECG-electrocardiogram-Heartbeat-Categorization
In this project i trained 2 deep learning models for ECG (electrocardiogram) Categorization of 5 types of heartbeat. I showed how a deep model could be trained for real world data and also showed the difference between a ANN vs a CNN when they are applied in ECG signals.
